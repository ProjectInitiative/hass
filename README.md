# Home Automation System

A comprehensive AppDaemon-based home automation system for Home Assistant, featuring garage control, lighting automation, door management, and notification systems.

## Core Features

### ðŸ“Š State History

The `GlobalStateManager` maintains entity state history:
- Maximum of 10 historical states per entity
- Timestamp tracking
- State locking capability
- Reversion to previous states

```python
# Revert to previous state
state_manager.revert_to_previous_state(entity_id, steps_back=1)

# Lock current state
state_manager.lock_state(entity_id)
```

### ðŸ”„ MQTT Integration

Automated MQTT entity creation:
- Dynamic topic generation
- Auto-discovery support
- State synchronization
- Availability tracking

Entity types:
- Switches
- Numbers
- Sensors
- Binary sensors

Example MQTT switch creation:
```python
switch = MQTTSwitch(
    entity_id="global_switch",
    name="Global Control Switch"
)
switch.initialize()  # Creates MQTT topics and discovery
```
