#   module: timer
#   class: AdvancedTimer
#   # List of timer configurations
#   timers:
#     # --- Example 1: Simple On/Off Schedule ---
#     # Turns on a light in the morning and off at night.
#     - id: morning_light_schedule
#       name: "Morning Living Room Light"
#       timezone: "America/New_York"
#       entities:
#         - light.living_room_lamp
#       schedule:
#         on: "07:00:00"
#         off: "09:30:00"

#     # --- Example 2: Time Window Enforcement ---
#     # Ensures a fan is running during the afternoon to circulate air.
#     # If the fan is manually turned off during this window, the app will turn it back on.
#     - id: afternoon_fan_window
#       name: "Afternoon Fan Circulation"
#       timezone: "America/Chicago"
#       entities:
#         - switch.office_fan
#       window:
#         start: "13:00:00"
#         end: "17:00:00"
#         # Optional: How often (in seconds) to check the state of the entities. Defaults to 60.
#         check_interval: 120

#     # --- Example 3: Overnight Window ---
#     # Keeps a security light on overnight.
#     - id: overnight_security_light
#       name: "Overnight Security Light"
#       timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
#       entities:
#         - light.outdoor_security_light
#       window:
#         start: "22:00:00"
#         end: "06:00:00"

#     # --- Example 4: Relative 'in X minutes' Timer ---
#     # Useful for temporary situations, like turning off a bathroom fan after a shower.
#     # This timer would typically be triggered by another automation or script that
#     # dynamically adds this configuration. For testing, you can add it here.
#     - id: bathroom_fan_off_delay
#       name: "Bathroom Fan Off Delay"
#       entities:
#         - fan.bathroom_fan
#       relative:
#         # Turns the fan off in 15 minutes from the time AppDaemon is started/reloaded.
#         off_in: 15 

#     # --- Example 5: Group of Entities ---
#     # Control multiple lights with one timer.
#     - id: evening_ambiance
#       name: "Evening Ambiance Lights"
#       timezone: "Europe/London"
#       entities:
_group
#         - light.living_room_accent
#         - light.dining_area_light
#       schedule:
#         on: "19:00:00"
#         off: "23:00:00"

#     # --- Example 6: Timer with Daylight Savings Disabled ---
#     # This timer will always operate at the standard time offset for its timezone,
#     # ignoring any daylight saving adjustments. For example, if "America/New_York"
#     # is used, the timer will always run at EST (UTC-5), even during EDT.
#     - id: fixed_offset_light
#       name: "Fixed Offset Light (No DST)"
#       timezone: "America/New_York"
#       daylight_savings: false
#       entities:
#         - light.kitchen_light
#       schedule:
#         on: "08:00:00"
#         off: "17:00:00"
